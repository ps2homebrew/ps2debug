PS2DEBUG
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This was written because I was having problems with Naplink and printf
causing the IOP to crash.  I had suspected that this was mainly due to 
the printf function not being thread safe.  I am still not entirely sure
if this solves any problems; however it does seem to make printf a little
more reliable when using multiple threads.

It has been modified slightly to now help in debugging ps2ip.  The ps2klsi
driver after initialising now redirects ps2debug's output to a udp_log
function.  This means that during startup ps2debug uses the standard printf
over naplink and then once the Ethernet adapter is initliased all logging
is performed via UDP.


You may or may not find this useful for anything you do. :)

ERRORS/BUGS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is currently a problem using variable arguments in the lock_printf
function.  As a temporary fix I have resolved this by simply printing the
format string.  There is a call to vsprintf, however when enabled the output
is an empty string.
